This shopping application is a demo that helped me to introduce myself in Android Programming.
Initially, this application was made as a solution for festival long queues at the vending stands at Polihack Hackathon.
I made it in Android Studio, using for the most part Java and XML.
It has 3 tabs:
-first tab used to display all available items for the user
-second tab used as the user basket with all items selected by user
-third tab used as a group basket with all the items of the users from that group.
The idea is that each user can join a group and each person of that group can buy for himself, 
but there will be a group order that can be taken by one person,
the payment is executed on application with tokens, but those parts were not implemented in this project so far.
